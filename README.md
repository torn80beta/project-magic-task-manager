even on the go in a mobile application. ***TaskPro*** can be comfortably used on devices with a screen width of 320px. When the screen width is less than 768px, the navigation buttons located on the Sidebar are moved to a modal menu, which is available by clicking on the `Burger Menu` icon. At the same time, for ease of use, the `Filter` and `Theme` remains available on the top panel.
